2: Data Retrieval and Parsing of Form 4 from the Edgar System using Multiple CPUs

Abstract—In this paper we present a parallelized system that retreives and parses Form 4 documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database (EDGAR). This information is very important for investors looking at insider trading information to make investment decisions. However, the information’s usefullness is inversly related to the time it takes to retreive and analyize the information. A sequential system is slow due to the latency associated with the retreval and parsing of the Form 4s, which on average exceeds 1000 per day. By parallelizing the retreival and parsing of Form 4s we were able to attain the max speed up of 20x, resulting in parsing of a daily index with 1000 forms in under 30 minutes instead of 9 hours it takes utilizing a single processor.

1: Market Data Extractor (MDX): A System to Download Market Data

Abstract—Stock market data is an important component to any person or entity interested in ﬁnancial markets. The issue with attaining the information is dependent on cost and/or time. One could browse through a data vendor such as Finance.Yahoo for the necessary data, however this is a very time consuming and a tedious process. Another option would be to purchase the data from a large data vendor at high costs. Both of these options are not cost effective in terms of time and/or money. The means for attaining market data should be both time and cost effective. In this paper we present such a system: Market Data Extractor (MDX). MDX is a system that is designed to extract market data and present it both graphically and numerically to the user. The user is not expected to program any part of the system to extract the data. It follows the Model View Controller architecture and keeps the complexity of the system hidden from the user. The user utilizes the system via a graphical interface. The system is user friendly, robust, secure and cross-platform.
